## AI-Assisted Development

This project is developed with [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code), powered by [oh-my-claudecode (OMC)](https://github.com/Yeachan-Heo/oh-my-claudecode) as its multi-agent orchestration layer.

- **`CLAUDE.md`** — Defines project-wide build commands, architecture, design conventions, and concurrency rules. Automatically loaded by Claude Code at session start.
- **`AGENTS.md`** — Hierarchical per-directory documentation placed throughout the codebase, enabling AI agents to quickly understand each module's purpose, constraints, and dependencies.

These files are automatically injected into the agent's context, so Claude Code understands the project structure and design intent without any additional explanation.

## Quick Start

1. Fork & clone the repo
2. Install [XcodeGen](https://github.com/yonaskolb/XcodeGen): `brew install xcodegen`
3. Generate the Xcode project: `xcodegen generate`
4. Build: `xcodebuild -project Whispree.xcodeproj -scheme Whispree -destination 'platform=macOS,arch=arm64' build`
5. Run tests: `xcodebuild -project Whispree.xcodeproj -scheme Whispree -destination 'platform=macOS,arch=arm64' test`

## Pull Requests

- Branch from `dev`
- Keep PRs focused — one feature or fix per PR
- Ensure the build passes before submitting
- Use [conventional commits](#commit-convention) for commit messages

## UI Palette Guidance

When adjusting dashboard, settings, or shared SwiftUI surfaces:

- Keep the sidebar's multi-color accent feel, but treat it as a navigation-specific exception.
- Converge content surfaces on a constrained palette: neutral surfaces, one interaction accent, and semantic status colors.
- Prefer `DesignTokens` and shared UI components over ad-hoc `Color.*` usage or one-off opacity mixes.
- Use semantic color only for meaning-bearing states such as badges, compatibility, and health indicators.
- If a new color is truly required, add it centrally in `Whispree/Views/Design/DesignTokens.swift` and update the relevant `AGENTS.md` guidance in the same change.

## Commit Convention

| Prefix | Use |
|--------|-----|
| `feat:` | New feature |
| `fix:` | Bug fix |
| `refactor:` | Code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature |
| `docs:` | Documentation only |
| `chore:` | Build process, dependencies, or tooling |
| `test:` | Adding or updating tests |

### Version Bumps

Include `GO LIVE X.X.X` in your commit message or PR title to set a specific release version:

```
feat: add new STT provider GO LIVE 1.1.0
```

Without `GO LIVE`, the patch version auto-increments on merge to `main`.
